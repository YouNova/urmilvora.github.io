# Redirect Repository for GitHub Pages

This repository is used to redirect the GitHub Pages site at:

**https://urmilvora.github.io**

to the main portfolio site hosted at:

**https://younova.github.io**

---

## Purpose

Since the portfolio site is maintained under the GitHub username **YouNova**, this repository serves only to redirect visitors from **urmilvora.github.io** to **younova.github.io**.

---

## How it works

- The `index.html` file contains a meta refresh tag that automatically redirects users to the main site.
- This allows multiple usernames to have URLs that lead to the same portfolio website without duplicating content.
